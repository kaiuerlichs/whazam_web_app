# Coursework 2 - API Mashup
You are being tasked with creating a web application that interacts with two pre-existing webAPIs. You should create an application that takes data from two different APIs and then combines these into a useful application. The overall functionality and topic domain of this is up to you. The main aim of this assignment is for you to showcase your web development skills to the best of your ability, however, the application must meet the following objectives:

-	The application should get data from a web API that is then parsed and displayed to the user
-	The user should be able to interact with the data being obtained from the API in some way
-	The application should not rely on any form of login system and should sit as a frontend only application
-	The application should use a combination of HTML / CSS / Javascript

A list of potential APIs that you may wish to consider can be found in the link below, and you should ensure that the APIs chosen are easily accessible using front end development techniques:
